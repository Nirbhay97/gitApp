    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Nirbhay Kumar, I am passionate about building <strong>Fast</strong> and <strong>Scalable Systems.</strong>
       I specilize in <strong>back-end development, React</strong>,  and have a keen eye for <strong>Algorithm Design and Data Structures</strong>.  My goal is to build
      robust and user-friendly applcations that make positive imapact. I mainly use <strong>Node.js(Express)</strong> and <strong>mongoDB</strong> for my projects.
    <p/>

    <p>
      From a young age, I was captivated by the world of coding. 
      I am pursuing <strong>B.Tech</strong> from  <strong>Vellore institute of Technology, Vellore Campus</strong>.
      where I gained a solid foundation in programming languages such as C, C++ and JavaScript. I have honed my skills through hands-on projects 
       and continuous learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      What drives me as a developer is the ability to bring ideas to life through code. 
      I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and 
      finding elegant solutions. I believe that technology should
      empower people and simplify their lives, and that belief is reflected
      in every line of code I write.
    </p>

      I am also interested in <strong>Competitive Programming</strong> and have been doing it for the past 2 years.
      It has helped me to improve my problem solving skills and has also helped me to think out of the box.
